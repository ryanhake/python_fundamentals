'''
Write a script that "flattens" a shallow list. For example:

starting_list = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Note that your input list only contains one level of nested lists.
This is called a "shallow list".

CHALLENGE: Do some research online and find a solution that works
to flatten a list of any depth. Can you understand the code used?

'''

starting_list = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flat_list = []
for sublist in starting_list:
    print("now working this sublist")
    print(sublist)
    for item in sublist:
        print("working with item")
        print(item)
        flat_list.append(item)
print(flat_list)
